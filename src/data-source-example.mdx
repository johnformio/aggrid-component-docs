# Connecting to a Data Source Component
You can use the `DataSource` component to connect the Grid to a data source. This component allows you to define how the Grid retrieves and manages data.

To use a Data Source, you need to add the `Data Source` component to your form and connect it to the grid using a *Custom Default Value* script in your grid.

## Custom Default Value Script
Use the following script in the *Custom Default Value* field of your grid to connect it to the Data Source:

    

```javascript
if (data.dataSource) {
  // dataSource is the property Name of the Data Source on the form
  instance.setRowData(data.dataSource)
}
```

<details>
 <summary>Explanation:</summary>
  - `data.dataSource` refers to the Data Source component on your form, check to see if it has been set.
  - `instance.rowData` is the component property you set as the grid data.
  - `instance.redraw()` refreshes the grid to display the new data.

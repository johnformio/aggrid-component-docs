## Configuring the Grid from your application
Ag-Grid has a very complex configuration system that allows you to customize the grid in many ways. It also exposes an api to programmatically change the grid at runtime.

You can access the api from the grid component by listening the the `agGridReady` event. This event is triggered when the grid is ready to be used and the api is available.

For example you can change the grid column configuration from the client application, in this example

```jsx
const onFormReadyHandler = (webform) => {
      const agGridComponent = webform.getComponent("aggrid");
      agGridComponent.on('agGridReady', ({api}) => {
        api.updateGridOptions({
            columnDefs:[
                { field: "company", headerName: "Company", pinned: true },
                { field: "mission", headerName: "Mission" },
                
                { field: "location", headerName: "Location" },
                { field: "date", headerName: "Date" },
                { field: "time", headerName: "Time" },
                { field: "rocket", headerName: "Rocket" },
                { field: "price", headerName: "Price" },
                { field: "successful", headerName: "Successful" },
            ],
            selectionColumnDef: {
                sortable: true,
                resizable: true,
                // width: 120,
                suppressHeaderMenuButton: false,
                pinned: "left",
              },
        })
      })
      
      
      
};


export default function GridConfigForm() {
    return (
        <Form
            form={spaceMissionForm}
            onFormReady={onFormReadyHandler}
            onSubmit={(submission) => {
                console.log('Submission:', submission);
              }}
        />  
    );
}
